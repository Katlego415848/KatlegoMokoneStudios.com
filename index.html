    <h3>My story</h3>
    <p>Hi, I'm Katlego Mokone</p>

      my career in web development and looking forward to collaborating with
      clients to bring their online version to life.

    </a>

    <p>
      I’ve designed several brochure-style demo websites for businesses such as gyms and event planning
      companies. These demo projects were created to showcase my web design and development skills, and
      to reflect the kind of clean, informative, and visually engaging sites I can build for real clients.
      Each website is structured to highlight services, introduce the brand, and provide essential
      information in a way that’s easy to navigate and visually appealing. While these sites are not
      for live businesses, they’re built with real-world functionality and attention to
      detail—just like a fully client-ready website.
    </p>

      <img src="Images/building.jpeg" id="img2" alt="A building demo website" />
    </a>

    <p>
      I’ve designed and developed a series of informational websites for service-based businesses such as construction
      companies, landscapers, and electricians. These projects were created as part of my portfolio to demonstrate my
      ability to build clean, responsive, and user-friendly websites tailored to industry needs. Each site is structured
      to clearly present services, build trust, and encourage customer inquiries—just like a real business site would.
      From layout and content to contact forms and mobile optimization, I focus on delivering a complete, functional
      user experience.

    </a>

    <p>
      I’ve also designed some portfolio-style demo websites for businesses such as studios and event planning
      companies. This is to again showcase my web design and development skills. By doing this I want to show
      my creativity and what I am able to do.
